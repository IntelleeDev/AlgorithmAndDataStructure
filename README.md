# Algorithms and Data Structures
A project containing implementations of popular algorithms and Data structures. As of now the project contains

## Algorithms
- Heap Permutations
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search
- Linear Search

## Data Structures
- LinkedList
- Graph
- Trees

## Reference Books
- Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas .H Cormen.
- The Art of Computer Programming - Volume 1,2,3, and 4 by Donald E.Knuth.
- Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany Levitim.
- Fundamentals of Data Structure by Ellis Horowitz

I do not endorse these books, but I put them here because I found an easy read with them. 
## Video Resources
An additional video resource to accompany "Introduction to Algorithms" would be :
- This Popular Khan Academy Course - https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms

If you would like to contribute to implementations of more Algorithms and Data structures, kindly fork the project and create a pull request.
